# Paytm - A spiced payments company
## Overview and Origin
Fintech is a broader category shaping the future of financial services. It covers a broad range of technologies and financial domains like Consumer Lending, Business Lending, Personal Finance, Payments Backend, Consumer Payments, POS Payments, Crowdfunding, International Money Transfer, SMB Tools, Institutional Investing, Retail Investing, Banking Infrastructure, Equity Financing, Financial Security, Research & Data, Consumer and Commercial Banking.

Payments are a crucial financial domain, which is under existence since the emergence of trade. The payment domain alone had major innovations and created various other domains. Recent advancements in telecommunication have pushed Payments domain and innovation to new limits. In this case study, I would like to discuss "Paytm" a payments company having origin in India and spreading its branches across the world.

Paytm is a company operating a mobile payment and commerce platform. It offers payments, banking, lending, and insurance services to consumers and merchants. The Company offers online use-cases like mobile recharges, utility bill payments, travel, movies, and events bookings, as well as in-store payments at grocery stores, restaurants, parking, tolls, pharmacies, and educational institutions with the Paytm QR Code.

Paytm was founded in August 2010 with an initial investment of $2 million by its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma in Noida. One97, the parent company of Paytm. They started experimenting with the three basics of internet- content, advertising, and commerce. But the big moment came in 2011 when Vijay Shekhar first pitched the idea of entering the payment ecosystem in front of his board. 

The board was not convinced, as Vijay Sekhar was talking about betting the company’s money on a non-existent market in India. During that time period, the Indian Telecommunication sector was lacking many advancements almost all mobile phone providers were either offering WAP or 2G network systems. So Vijay Shekhar took a risky decision by investing 1% of his equity, which was about $2 million around 2011 and started Paytm.

Recently, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, CEO of One97 Communication has confirmed that company has raised $1 billion led by T Rowe Price, SoftBank has invested in $200 million, Ant Financial has invested $400 million and from various other investors like AGH Holdings, SAIF Partners, Berkshire Hathaway, and Discovery Capital, at a $16 billion valuation. This was over a 45% jump from its $10.5 billion valuations in its valuation report as of September 2019.
## Business Activities:
Paytm's core business has always revolved around payments. But the company sees itself more as a 'problem solver' than a bank or a tech firm. The first pain point the company solved for India's consumers was around pre-paid mobile top-ups: Paytm allowed customers to top their accounts up instantly on their phones rather than going to a store, buying a top-up card and struggling with an extraordinarily long password. That allowed it to build brand awareness and a loyal customer base.

The company's next objective was much more ambitious — to make India's payment system more inclusive, more efficient, and more reliable. It was an audacious goal. When the company was founded, the vast majority of India's population had no access to formal banking services at all. Those that did have bank accounts often struggled to use the instruments available to them. Less than 2 percent of the population had a credit account. Cash and cheques were the norms.

The idea of accessing easy online payments fell short, and customers ended up with nothing but a poor experience. Paytm offered itself as a better alternative in this regard and its purpose is to serve its Indian customer base particularly the mobile phone users. Many Indian customers viewed the digital world as providing an easy opportunity for them to open a bank account. However, it didn’t turn out to be the case.

Paytm wallet and other payment methods available on the app have continued to grow. Overall, Paytm continues to dominate digital payments and has over 50% of the market share of mobile payments to merchants, Paytm has the largest offline merchant network in the country with over 17 million merchants. Paytm has over 10 million daily transacting users. Facing very tough competition from international giants like Google Pay, Phone Pe, Amazon Pay.

Majority of its customer were illiterate and it was entering into the market, where the mobile 4G technology and smartphone technology was new so their main objective was to easy onboarding of merchants.Merchants can sign up for PayTM without a bank account. They can receive money into their PayTM wallets without a bank account. They can even spend their wallet balance by shopping at other merchants that accept PayTM payments. It's only when they want to cash out their money from their PayTM account that they need a bank account.

As a result, PayTM was/is able to sign up hundreds of thousands of merchants that don't have bank accounts. These merchants could sign up for PayTM as soon as they had a compelling need to accept cashless payments i.e. immediately after the demonetization announcement, start accepting payments, and visit banks later to open their accounts after their PayTM account balances started growing.

Contrast this with competing e-wallets, which insist that merchants link their bank accounts (or debit cards or credit cards) to their apps right at the time of installing them. As a result, financially-excluded merchants couldn't sign up for them when they had a compelling need. PayTM's rivals lost this market to PayTM.

PayTM followed the same principle as Paypal. When PayPal launched in the late 1990s, it incented existing users to send money to non-users. When users sent money to their friends and family members (that were not on PayPal), PayPal sent them an email saying “Collect $$ by signing up for PayPal". This gives non-users a far more compelling reason to join PayPal than any direct advertising or PR efforts could have and generated a massive amount of viral distribution for PayPal.

PayTM’s competitors were on a different track, They insist that payments can be made only to people that have already signed up to their e-wallets. PayTM and PayPal get it. Their competitors don't. Instead, they put their prospective users at the mercy of their respective banks to gain signups.

Aftermath of Demonetization had created a lot of business opportunities, PayTM salespersons made daily rounds in retail hotspots asking storekeepers if they wanted PayTM.In sharp contrast, most competitors of PayTM haven't harnessed the power of feet-on-street to recruit merchants. Instead, they seem to expect merchants to sign up in self-service mode.

By design or default, the Sign Out link in PayTM’s mobile app is buried deep inside the app. As a result, many users have never seen it and stay logged into their apps all the time. This means they're able to make a payment without a password or PIN. This creates a significant security vulnerability in PayTM. But it also makes PayTM's CX that much more frictionless, which makes a lot of difference when people use it many times a day.PayTM has understood and capitalized on this element of consumer behavior. Its competitors have totally missed it.

PayTM preloads its wallet on the fly without user intervention. As a result, users wary of having to top up prepaid mobile wallets before initiating payments find the PayTM experience superior to that of other mobile wallets, which bumps them off with a message asking them to load enough money into their wallets first and then reattempt the payment.

Paytm is using DEV/OPS model and products in Paytm’s tech stack include Amazon (Elastic Load Balancing, EC2, Route 53), Atlassian JIRA, GitHub, Google (Cloud Messaging, Maps), HTML5, Materialize, OpenResty, OpenSearch, and Rollbar, WordPress.

## Landscape:
The dynamic payments industry continues to expand and evolve, with digital payment vehicles and transaction volumes growing across the globe. Over the past year, industry incumbents have been responding to numerous trends and drivers by:
* Modernizing their organizations and infrastructure to support new service offerings and identify new revenue streams.
* Investing in cloud computing and other digital technologies to more rapidly address evolving customer preferences and mitigate risk and regulatory obligations.
* Engaging in targeted M&A to fill in adjacencies and add capabilities and talent to address challenging areas such as cross-border payments, and improved end-to-end payment experience, multi-payment integration, and business-to-business (B2B) payments.
* Collaborating with financial technology (fintech) players and other market entrants as strategies and playbooks for partnering continue to evolve.

Even after achieving major milestones like Customer base and valuation, this billion-dollar have to tough competitions from its competitors in domestic as well as international markets.

## Results
Paytm was already big news before Modi’s demonetization shock, when the Indian government withdrew all the Rp500 and Rp1,000 banknotes from circulation to curb corruption and the black economy, but demonetization gave the company an almighty lift. Indian government's move completely pole axed India’s cash transaction economy and forced people, and in particular, the small merchants who are legion in the country, to look at alternatives.  The Paytm wallet was the simplest answer and people flocked to it. It went from 125 million wallet customers before demonetization to 185 million three months later, and it has continued to grow, hitting 280 million users by November 2017. 

Over the past two years, Paytm had already begun to lose its tight grip on India’s $65 billion mobile payments market because of rival Google’s payment service grew rapidly in the country after the Indian government launched an open-source payment system that made it easier for the U.S. giant to compete in the market. In December, the number of Paytm users who made at least one payment during the month declined to less than 40 million, from about 45 million a year earlier.

## Recommendations
Payments domain has developed a lot and the current pandemic has pushed it to the next level and innovations in other fields are opening up many options. I would recommend two options to the Paytm,

**Payments via House Hold Appliances**
* The possibilities opened up by the Internet of Things are endless, which would allow integrating payment systems with everyday objects like Cars and Television. Television is still being considered as a major source of entertainment in many countries, linking the payment system with television should allow the customer to buy product's while commercial is being featured on the TV.
* Offering this option would increase the customer base, it is not only covering customers with a mobile phone with 4G technology. Developing countries in Asia and Africa which are lacking telecommunication infrastructure would provide an option to make payments via their household appliances.
* Recent advancements in Internet of Things which can help to make televisions and refrigerators as payment devices and Deep learning would be very helpful in analyzing the local and needs and advertise the contents based on geographical location and blockchain would help make transactions more secure and it would help countries and individuals to move into digital currency and digital wallets.
